# Intel-devcloud-smart-queueing-system-job

Three real world scenarios given to analyze and optimize their queuing systems. This project demonstrates how to identify the appropriate Intel Hardware types that will work best for the manufacturing, retail and transportation scenarios. This application uses the Intel DevCloud.

## Devcloud Usage Steps
There are 5 different Jupyter Notebooks as follows;

1. Create model inference Python Script
2. Create the Job Submission Script
3. Work on Manufacturing Scenario using the Jupyter notebook
4. Work on Retail Scenario using the Jupyter notebook
5. Work on Transportation Scenario using the Jupyter notebook

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See prerequisites for notes on how to run or deploy this project.

## Prerequisites

- Test video inputs for each of the scenarios are needed.
- An Intel Edge Account on Intel Edge DevCloud is needed for this project.
